# PhD Portfolio — Sakshi Arora

This repository is a curated hub showcasing my doctoral work at the intersection of **artificial intelligence, cheminformatics, and experimental aging biology**.

My research philosophy centers on **closing the loop between computation and biology**: developing interpretable ML models, generating experimentally testable hypotheses, and validating predictions using in vitro and in vivo aging assays.

## 🧭 Research Overview

Aging is a pleiotropic, multi-pathway process that cannot be decoded through black-box prediction alone. During my PhD, I developed **mechanism-aware computational frameworks** that explicitly incorporate biological reasoning and are designed to interface directly with experimental validation.

Key experimental systems used:
- Yeast chronological lifespan (CLS)
- Mammalian cell-based senescence and toxicity assays
- *C. elegans* lifespan and healthspan models
